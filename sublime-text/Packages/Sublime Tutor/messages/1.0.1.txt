This version brings a lot of fixes to commands and shortcuts being used here.
Largely reported by the community and a lot of it was made possible because
of various contributors on github. I hope this edition helps you in your
journey to learn Sublime Text and become a more productive user.

If you come across any issue, please send a feedback email to
hello+sublimetutor@jai.im or report it at the github repository. Thank you.
