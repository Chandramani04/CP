Quick find
===========

What if you don't want to open the search panel up but want to search for the
currently selected term in the document with just one keystroke. These cases
happen to be quite common in software development. This command does exactly
that.

Shortcut - `Ctrl + F3`

Select a term or put your cursor on a word and press `Ctrl + F3` to find other
occurrences of it in the document.


Exercise
---------

1. In the list given below, put your cursor on the term `phone` and then use
   the shortcut `Ctrl + F3` to cycle through all other occurrences of this word.
2. Do the same with all other terms (windows, iOS, OSX...) in the list.

```

phone
windows
iOS
OSX
linux
ubuntu
phone
ubuntu

```


Quick find previous
====================

While quick find command executes in top to bottom order, quick find previous
command does exactly the same thing but in the opposite order.

Shortcut - `Ctrl + Shift + F3`


Exercise
---------

1. In the list given above, use the quick find previous shortcut
   (`Ctrl + Shift + F3`) to cycle through other occurrences of a term in the
   opposite order.

Quick find all
===============

The above two commands are good for cycle through all the occurrences one by
by one. What if you want all commands selected (multiple cursor mode) for the
selected search term?

Quick find all command will help us achieve that.

Shortcut - `Alt + F3`


Exercise
