Sorting lines
==============

You have shown lovely progress till now. You have sorted a block of text
two times in unit 4 and then 8. Second time, it took less time time than
the first one. What if I tell you that you can sort lines in Sublime Text
with just one keystroke?

`F9` to the rescue.

Unlike other text transformation commands, this one uses function keys to
do the magic. To remember, correlate `9` with the shape of `S` in `S`orting.


Exercise
---------

Let's do the same exercise again using this shortcut now.

1. First, drag select the block. Use `F9` directly to sort all these lines.
2. Now delete the lines using `delete line` shortcut you learned in unit 4 of
   this module.

```

6. This is line number six
1. This is line number one
6. This is line number six
5. This is line number five
4. This is line number four
3. This is line number three
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three

```

Tip: In case if you want to do a case sensitive sorting of lines, using `Ctrl`
key. `Ctrl + F9`


Wonderful! Let's move to chapter_2_10.md now.
