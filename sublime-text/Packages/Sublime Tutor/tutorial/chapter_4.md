We had a brief introduction to `Goto Anything` command in the first module of
this course, and it has been our friend ever since to move from one unit to
another.

We'll be learning about its cousins in this module, this should certainly make
your stay at Sublime Text a pleasurable experience.

Let's start with refreshing our memory with the shortcuts that we studied in
the first module.

* Goto anything - `Ctrl + P`
* Goto line - `Ctrl + G`
* Goto symbol - `Ctrl + R`

While it is quite easy to look for a symbol in a specific file, Sublime Text 3
comes with a feature that lets you search for a symbol or definition project-
wide.

Let's move to next chapter to learn this.
