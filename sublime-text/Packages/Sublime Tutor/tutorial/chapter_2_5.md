Soft Undo / Redo
=================

Shortcuts for `undo` and `redo` commands are `Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Y`
which is a standard on Win/Linux. But here, we are talking about 'soft' undo
and redo actions.

Sublime has ability to track your cursor position in the history. So, when you
move your cursor from one position to another, or select something, Sublime can
easily undo these 'soft' actions as well.

Shortcuts for soft undo and redo are:

* Soft undo - `Ctrl + U`
* Soft redo - `Ctrl + Shift + U`


Exercise
---------

Move your cursor using your mouse from one position to another, delete some
words, select some area, then again delete some words. Once you are done with
that, use soft undo with `Ctrl + U` shortcut to delete all this. Then try
redoing it with `Ctrl + Shift + U` and then undo that action again and come in
the original position.


Revision
