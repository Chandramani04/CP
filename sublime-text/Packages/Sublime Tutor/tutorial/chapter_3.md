Selection
==========

Selection is one of the most powerful features of Sublime Text. It gives you
number of ways to select text in the easiest way possible. In this module,
we'll build our skill-set in multiple selection, column selection, different
levels of selection on a word, line, block and scope. Once some text is
selected, you can do some advanced text editing operations on it.

Let's move to the first unit of this module. `chapter_3_1.md`
