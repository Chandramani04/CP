Delete / Cut a line
===========================

In the previous chapter you learned how to delete a line from the cursor
location in forward or backward direction. What if you want to delete the whole
line? This unit introduces you to a couple of shortcuts that you can use for
the same purpose.

Delete a line - `Ctrl + Shift + K`

Cut a line - `Ctrl + X`
  If you put the cursor on any line and press `Ctrl + X` then it would cut the
  whole line and put it in the clipboard. You can later paste it using
  `Ctrl + V` as usual.


Exercise 1
-----------

There are some lines written below, some of them are repeated. You need to make
sure that all the lines appear only once. Use the command `Ctrl + Shift + K` to
delete those lines.

```

1. This is line number one
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three
3. This is line number three
4. This is line number four
5. This is line number five
6. This is line number six
6. This is line number six

```


Exercise 2
-----------

There are six unique lines written below, you need to sort them and make sure
all their duplicates are deleted. So in the end the remaining list should have

just 6 items. To do this, use `Ctrl + X` to cut a line, including its line
break, `Ctrl + V` to paste that line back. Once they are sorted, delete the
lines which are not required using `Ctrl + Shift + K`.


```

6. This is line number six
1. This is line number one
6. This is line number six
5. This is line number five
4. This is line number four
3. This is line number three
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three

```
