Find in project
================

If I had an option to keep only two shortcuts in Sublime Text, then I would
opt for `Goto anything` and `Find in project`. That is just to give you an
idea, how frequently you are going to use this shortcut.

This is equivalent to `grep` command of the shell world.

Shortcut - `Ctrl + Shift + F`

Let us search for some terms project wide and come back to this chapter then.


Exercise
---------

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + F` to open `Find in project` panel.
2. In the `Find` field type `class Foo` and press `Return`.
   (Quick tip here: `Ctrl + E` and `Ctrl + Shift + E` can be used for adding
   the currently selected word in find or replace panel)
3. You get a list of matched terms in a new tab. If found, the search term
   will be highlighted. Double clicking on a line with highlighted search term
   will automatically open the file and take us to the corresponding line
   number.
4. Try this with 4-5 different search terms and make yourself comfortable with
   this command.
5. When you are done playing around with this, move to next module.


We have reached almost the end of this course. The next module (and also the
last) introduces you to Python console in Sublime Text and how to edit settings
which are managed through means of some `JSON` files.

Over to next module - `chapter_6.md`
