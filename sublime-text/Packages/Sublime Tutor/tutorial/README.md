                                                         FOR SUBLIME TEXT 3


Sublime Text 3 is a powerful and easy to use text editor. An ultra simple user
interface beautifully hides all the complexity behind. You can start using the
editor without knowing any details, which is great for beginners.

When I started using Sublime Text, I was a migrant from the world of TextMate
and Vim. While a lot of keyboard shortcuts and features were similar to
TextMate, some looked alien as well. Earlier, when I was learning Vim, I had
found vimtutor to be of great help. In my early days with Sublime, I was
looking for a similar solution which could interactively teach new shortcuts
inside the editor itself.

This tutorial is inspired from classic vimtutor. You will get to learn
some handy shortcuts to work with Sublime Text 3. By the end of this tutorial,
you would be familiar with ST's most important and frequently used shortcuts
and features.

The tutorial uses spaced repetition technique to make sure that your newly
acquired skills are well persisted.


Symbols Used in this guide
---------------------------

    Ctrl - the Control Key
    Alt – the Option Key
    Shift – the Shift Key
    Esc – the ESC Key
    Return – the Return
    Delete – the Delete / Backspace


Getting Started
----------------

You can use `Ctrl + Alt + K` keyboard shortcut anytime to open sublime tutor.
Another option is to go to `Help > Sublime Tutor` menu option to open this.

Tip: Invoke Sublime Text 3 from OSX command line:

Make a symlink to `subl`. Assuming you've placed Sublime Text in `Applications`
folder on Mac, and that you have ~/bin directory in your `PATH`, you can run:

    $ ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime

Now you can use `sublime` command in your terminal to open Sublime Text 3. If
you put a `.` after the command, it will open the current directory in Sublime.

    $ sublime

or

    $ sublime .


Navigate to the first chapter
------------------------------

The first feature you'll learn is 'Goto anything' shortcut. Use `Ctrl + P` and
then type `1`, this would give you a list of files matched. Select
the first option (`1.md`) using `Down` arrow key followed by `Return`

When you press `Down` arrow key, Sublime show you a preview of the contents of
the file. You can exit it anytime by pressing `Esc` key on you keyboard.

Tip:

If you want to see contents of this tutorial, you can open contents.md anytime.
