Code folding / unfolding
=========================

When you are working with nested code structures, you can see a folded view
of your code to get a larger picture.

* Fold one level - `Ctrl + Shift + [`
* Unfold code one level - `Ctrl + Shift + ]`


Exercise
---------

Let's try this with the following HTML code structure.

1. Put your cursor inside the `p` text somewhere.
2. Use the `Fold one level` shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + [`
3. While `Ctrl` and `Shift` keys are depressed, press `[` key multiple times so
   that whole code structure is completely folded.
4. Now use the shortcut for unfolding code `Ctrl + Shift + ]` until full code
   is visible.

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  <title>Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <h1>Some heading</h1>
      <p>Example paragraph</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```

move from one place to another in the Sublime World. Let's learn how to find
stuff that we are looking for, in shortest time possible. Off to the next
