Goto Anything (`Ctrl + P`)
===========================

Give yourself a pat on the back. You just used your first keyboard shortcut.

This is probably the most frequently used command in Sublime Text. While a
project is open, you can use this command to move from one file to another,
search symbols defined in a file, go to a specific line number.

Let's give it another try. Follow the instructions below:

1. Press `Ctrl + P`
2. This shows you Goto Anything panel. Typing name of a file should filter out
   names of files.
3. Type `c1rb` and press `Return`
