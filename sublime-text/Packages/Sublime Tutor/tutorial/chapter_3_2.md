Column Selection
=================

If you want to have multiple cursors in a column, then `Ctrl + click` could
become cumbersome pretty soon. For this, there is another convenient method
that Sublime Text provides.

Column selection using mouse - `Shift + right click and drag`
Keyboard shortcut - `Ctrl + Alt + Up` or `Ctrl + Alt + Down`

For Linux users, this one is slightly different for you:
Keyboard shortcut - `Alt + Shift + Up` or `Alt + Shift + Down`


Exercise
---------

Following on from the exercise in chapter_3_1.md, do the same thing again but
this time using column selection keyboard shortcut.

In the list given below add an asterisk followed by space (`* `) in the
beginning of each item. Put your cursor at the beginning of the word `tab`.
Then press `Ctrl + Alt + Down`. This will put you into column selection mode.
Now keep selecting more rows on column 1 as you hold the `down` arrow key.
Once the first column of every item is selected, type `* ` (asterisk followed
by space).

```

tab
caps lock
shift
control
command
option
space

```

Try these two shortcuts on your existing work now. See, how more productive you
already feel!
