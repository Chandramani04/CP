Upper / lower case
===================

You can use two handy shortcuts to change the case of any text block in Sublime.

* Lower case - `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + L`
* Upper case - `Ctrl + K, Ctrl + U`

That is, press `Ctrl + K` directly followed by `Ctrl + L` or `Ctrl + U` to
change the case. In practice, you don't need to pull your finger from the `Ctrl`
key while doing that. So, press `Ctrl` with `K` and then lift your finger from
`K` and press `U` to make an upper case transform.


Exercise
---------

Toggle the case of all the words given below. If the existing case is lower
then make it upper, if the existing case is upper, then make it lower.

```

TOGGLE
case
OF
all
the
WORDS
of
this
BLOCK

```
