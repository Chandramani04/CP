Bubble the line up / down
==========================

If you remember from chapter 2.4 exercise 2, in order to sort the lines you
had to cut the lines first and then paste the line back. If all you wanted 
to do was to move the complete line above or below, you could use this 
handy shortcut that Sublime Text provides.


* Bubble the line up - `Ctrl + Shift + Up`
* Bubble the line down - `Ctrl + Shift + Down`


Exercise
---------

Let's do the same exercise again using these shortcuts now.

1. First sort the block given below using the newly learned shortcut
   in this unit (`Ctrl + Shift + Up`, `Ctrl + Shift + Down`)
2. Now delete the lines using `delete line` shortcut you learned in unit 4 of
   this module. Let's see if you still remember that or not?

```

6. This is line number six
1. This is line number one
6. This is line number six
5. This is line number five
4. This is line number four
3. This is line number three
2. This is line number two
2. This is line number two
3. This is line number three

```


Revision Exercise

You are moving ahead with flying colors. Way to go. We have reached mid-way
