Insert line before / after
===========================

You can directly add a line above or below your cursor position
and move your cursor directly to that location.

* Insert line before - `Ctrl + Shift + Return`
* Insert line after - `Ctrl + Return`


Exercise
---------

1. Place your cursor anywhere on the line marked `<==` in the first block below
2. Insert a line before and after using the shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + Return`
   and `Ctrl + Return` consecutively
3. Do the same thing with other blocks as well.
3. Each block should now look as the block below:

```

This is first line

I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==

This is last line

```


First block
------------

```

This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line

```


Second block
-------------

```

This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line

```


Third block
------------

```

This is first line
I have been sandwiched between the two above and below <==
This is last line

```


Now proceed to next chapter with the familiar `Goto Anything` shortcut. The
filename is chapter_2_2.md
