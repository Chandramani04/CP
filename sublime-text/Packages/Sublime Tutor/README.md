                                                         FOR SUBLIME TEXT 3

Sublime Text 3 is a powerful and easy to use text editor. An ultra simple user
interface beautifully hides all the complexity behind. You can start using the
editor without knowing any details, which is great for beginners.

When I started using Sublime Text, I was a migrant from the world of TextMate
and Vim. While a lot of keyboard shortcuts and features were similar to
TextMate, some looked alien as well. Earlier, when I was learning Vim, I had
found vimtutor to be of great help. In my early days with Sublime, I was
looking for a similar solution which could interactively teach new shortcuts
inside the editor itself.

This tutorial is inspired from classic vimtutor. You will get to learn
some handy shortcuts to work with Sublime Text 3. By the end of this tutorial,
you would be familiar with ST's most important and frequently used shortcuts
and features.

The tutorial uses spaced repetition technique to make sure that your newly
acquired skills are well persisted.
