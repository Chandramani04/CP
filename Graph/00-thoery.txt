directed graph : a graph in which all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.
undirected graph : a graph in which all the edges are bidirectional.

cyclic graph : a graph that contains a cycle. A cycle is a path of edges that starts and ends on the same vertex.
acyclic graph : a graph that does not contain a cycle.

path : a sequence of vertices in a graph connected by edges. any vertex in the graph can be visited only once.

degree of a vertex : the number of edges connected to a vertex.
total degree of a graph = 2 * number of edges in the graph = sum of degrees of all vertices in the graph.

for a directed graph : in-degree of a vertex = number of edges coming into the vertex.
                      out-degree of a vertex = number of edges going out of the vertex.

bipartite graph : a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.
            color the vertices of the graph with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

linear graph : a graph in which all vertices have degree 2. i.e. no cycle is present in the graph 

all linear graphs are bipartite graphs but all bipartite graphs are not linear graphs.
any graph with even cycle length is bipartite.

topological sort : only possible for directed acyclic graphs(DAG).     by DFS 
    nodes are arranged in such a way that if a node u has a directed edge to node v, then u comes before v in the ordering.


Kahn's algorithm :  topo sort using BFS , only valid for DAG
